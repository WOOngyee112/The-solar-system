    <h2>URANUS</h2>
    <img src="Uranus_Voyager2_color_calibrated.png">
    <p>Uranus is the seventh planet from the Sun. It is a gaseous cyan-coloured ice giant. Most of the planet is made of water,
         ammonia, and methane in a supercritical phase of matter, astronomy calls "ice" or volatiles. The planet's atmosphere 
         has a complex layered cloud structure and has the lowest minimum temperature of 49 K (−224 °C; −371 °F) out of all the 
         Solar System's planets. It has a marked axial tilt of 82.23° with a retrograde rotation period of 17 hours and 14 
         minutes. This means that in an 84-Earth-year orbital period around the Sun, its poles get around 42 years of continuous
          sunlight, followed by 42 years of continuous darkness.</p>

    <p>Uranus has the third-largest diameter and fourth-largest mass among the Solar System's planets. Based on current models,
         inside its volatile mantle layer is a rocky core, and surrounding it is a thick hydrogen and helium atmosphere. Trace 
         amounts of hydrocarbons (thought to be produced via hydrolysis) and carbon monoxide along with carbon dioxide (thought
          to have been originated from comets) have been detected in the upper atmosphere. There are many unexplained climate 
          phenomena in Uranus's atmosphere, such as its peak wind speed of 900 km/h (560 mph), variations in its polar cap, 
          and its erratic cloud formation. The planet also has very low internal heat compared to other giant planets, the cause
           of which remains unclear.</p>
    <p>Like the other giant planets, Uranus has a ring system, a magnetosphere, and many natural satellites. The extremely dark
         ring system reflects only about 2% of the incoming light. Uranus's 28 natural satellites include 18 known regular moons,
          of which 13 are small inner moons. Further out are the larger five major moons of the planet: Miranda, Ariel, Umbriel,
           Titania, and Oberon. Orbiting at a much greater distance from Uranus are the nine known irregular moons. The planet's
            magnetosphere is highly asymmetric and has many charged particles, which may be the cause of the darkening of its 
            rings and moons.</p>
