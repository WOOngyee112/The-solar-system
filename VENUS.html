    <h2>VENUS</h2>
    <img src="Venus_2_Approach_Image.jpg">
    <p> Venus is the second planet from the Sun. It is a terrestrial planet and is the closest in mass and size to its orbital 
        neighbour Earth. Venus is notable for having the densest atmosphere of the terrestrial planets, composed mostly of 
        carbon dioxide with a thick, global sulfuric acid cloud cover. At the surface it has a mean temperature of 737 K 
        (464 °C; 867 °F) and a pressure of 92 times that of Earth's at sea level. These extreme conditions compress carbon 
        dioxide into a supercritical state close to Venus's surface. </p>

    <p> Internally, Venus has a core, mantle, and crust. Venus lacks an internal dynamo, and its weakly induced magnetosphere is
        caused by atmospheric interactions with the solar wind. Internal heat escapes through active volcanism,resulting
        in resurfacing instead of plate tectonics. Venus is one of two planets in the Solar System, the other being Mercury, that 
        have no moons. Conditions perhaps favourable for life on Venus have been identified at its cloud layers. Venus may 
        have had liquid surface water early in its history with a habitable environment, before a runaway greenhouse 
        effect evaporated any water and turned Venus into its present state. </p>
        
    <p> The rotation of Venus has been slowed and turned against its orbital direction (retrograde) by the currents and drag of 
        its atmosphere. It takes 224.7 Earth days for Venus to complete an orbit around the Sun, and a Venusian solar year is 
        just under two Venusian days long. The orbits of Venus and Earth are the closest between any two Solar System planets, 
        approaching each other in synodic periods of 1.6 years. Venus and Earth have the lowest difference in gravitational 
        potential of any pair of Solar System planets. This allows Venus to be the most accessible destination and a useful 
        gravity assist waypoint for interplanetary flights from Earth.</p>
