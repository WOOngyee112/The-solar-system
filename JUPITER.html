        Jupiter is the fifth planet from the Sun and the largest in the Solar System. A gas giant, Jupiter's mass is more than 
        two and a half times that of all the other planets in the Solar System combined and slightly less than one one-thousandth
         the mass of the Sun. Jupiter orbits the Sun at a distance of 5.20 AU (778.5 Gm) with an orbital period of 11.86 years. 
         It is the third brightest natural object in the Earth's night sky after the Moon and Venus and has been observed since 
         prehistoric times. Its name derives from Jupiter, the chief deity of ancient Roman religion.

        Jupiter was the first planet to form, and its inward migration during the primordial Solar System impacted much of the 
        formation history of the other planets. Hydrogen constitutes 90% of Jupiter's volume, followed by helium, which forms 
        25% of its mass and 10% of its volume. The ongoing contraction of Jupiter's interior generates more heat than the planet
         receives from the Sun. Its internal structure is believed to consist of an outer mantle of fluid metallic hydrogen and
          a diffuse inner core of denser material. Because of its rapid rotation rate of one rotation per ten hours, Jupiter's 
          shape is an oblate spheroid; it possesses a slight but noticeable bulge around the equator. The outer atmosphere is 
          divided into a series of latitudinal bands, with turbulence and storms along their interacting boundaries. The most 
          obvious result of this is the Great Red Spot, a giant storm that has been recorded since at least 1831.

        Jupiter is surrounded by a faint planetary ring system and has a powerful magnetosphere, the second largest contiguous 
        structure in the Solar System (after the heliosphere). Jupiter forms a system of 95 known moons and probably many more, 
        including the four large moons discovered by Galileo Galilei in 1610: Io, Europa, Ganymede, and Callisto. Ganymede, 
        the largest of the four, is larger than the planet Mercury. Callisto is the second largest; Io and Europa are approximately
         the size of Earth's Moon.
    </p>
    <p>
        Since 1973, Jupiter has been visited by nine robotic probes: seven flybys and two dedicated orbiters, with one more en 
        route and one awaiting launch.
