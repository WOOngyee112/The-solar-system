    <p>  The Sun is the star at the center of the Solar System. It is a massive, nearly perfect sphere of hot plasma, heated to 
        incandescence by nuclear fusion reactions in its core, radiating the energy from its surface mainly as visible light 
        and infrared radiation with 10% at ultraviolet energies. It is by far the most important source of energy for life on 
        Earth. The Sun has been an object of veneration in many cultures. It has been a central subject for astronomical research
        since antiquity.</p>

    <p>  The Sun orbits the Galactic Center at a distance of 24,000 to 28,000 light-years. From Earth, it is 1 AU (1.496Ã—108 km) or
        about 8 light-minutes away. Its diameter is about 1,391,400 km (864,600 mi), 109 times that of Earth. Its mass is about 
        330,000 times that of Earth, making up about 99.86% of the total mass of the Solar System. Roughly three-quarters of the 
        Sun's mass consists of hydrogen (~73%); the rest is mostly helium (~25%), with much smaller quantities of heavier elements,
        ncluding oxygen, carbon, neon, and iron.</p>
        
    <p>  The Sun is a G-type main-sequence star (G2V), informally called a yellow dwarf, though its light is actually white. 
        It formed approximately 4.6 billion[a] years ago from the gravitational collapse of matter within a region of a large 
        molecular cloud. Most of this matter gathered in the center, whereas the rest flattened into an orbiting disk that became
        the Solar System. The central mass became so hot and dense that it eventually initiated nuclear fusion in its core. Every
        second, the Sun's core fuses about 600 billion kilograms (kg) of hydrogen into helium and converts 4 billion kg of matter
        into energy.</p>
