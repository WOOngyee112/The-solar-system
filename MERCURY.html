         Mercury is the first planet from the Sun and the smallest in the Solar System. In English, it is named after the ancient
        Roman god Mercurius (Mercury), god of commerce and communication, and the messenger of the gods. Mercury is classified 
        as a terrestrial planet, with roughly the same surface gravity as Mars. The surface of Mercury is heavily cratered, as
        a result of countless impact events that have accumulated over billions of years. Its largest crater, Caloris Planitia,
        has a diameter of 1,550 km (960 mi) and one-third the diameter of the planet (4,880 km or 3,030 mi). Similarly to the 
        Earth's Moon, Mercury's surface displays an expansive rupes system generated from thrust faults and bright ray systems
        formed by impact event remnants.</p>

    <p>  Mercury's sidereal year (88.0 Earth days) and sidereal day (58.65 Earth days) are in a 3:2 ratio. This relationship is 
        called spin–orbit resonance, and sidereal here means "relative to the stars". Consequently, one solar day (sunrise to 
        sunrise) on Mercury lasts for around 176 Earth days: twice the planet's sidereal year. This means that one side of 
        Mercury will remain in sunlight for one Mercurian year of 88 Earth days; while during the next orbit, that side will be 
        in darkness all the time until the next sunrise after another 88 Earth days.</p>

     <p> Combined with its high orbital eccentricity, the planet's surface has widely varying sunlight intensity and temperature,
        with the equatorial regions ranging from −170 °C (−270 °F) at night to 420 °C (790 °F) during sunlight. Due to the very 
        small axial tilt, the planet's poles are permanently shadowed. This strongly suggests that water ice could be present in 
        the craters. Above the planet's surface is an extremely tenuous exosphere and a faint magnetic field that is strong 
        enough to deflect solar winds. Mercury has no natural satellite.</p>
